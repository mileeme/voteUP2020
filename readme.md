# VoteUp2020

Voteup is a fun election candidate comparison tool imagined liked a dating app to see how your values compare to the values of those up for election, starting with the presidential candidates in the upcoming 2020 election.

# Stats
Almost half of eligible voters did not show up for the 2016 election with greater disparities for those under 30 and in minority communities. In fact, less than 40% of people under 30 turned out for the election.

# Goal
Beyond apathy for candidates, restrictive voting laws which may hurt voter turnout within minorities, we found that much of the huddle was due to complexity in understanding candidate positioning. Our goal is to make the process of learning fun and easy so that more people will show up for the November 2020 election.
