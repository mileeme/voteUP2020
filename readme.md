# VoteUp2020

Votup.app represents the presidential candidate's stance on the issues Americans care about in a fun, mad libs-like application.

# Stats
Almost half of eligible voters did not show up for the 2016 election with greater disparities for those under 30 and in minority communities. In fact, less than 40% of people under 30 made their voice count in electing the 45th president of the United States.

# Goal
Beyond apathy for candidates, restrictive voting laws which may hurt voter turnout within minorities, we discovered one of the main barriers to voting was due to complexity in candidate positioning. Through simple, fact-based research, we hope to empower people to vote with confidence in the upcoming 2020 Presidential Election.
