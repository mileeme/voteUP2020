# VoteUp2020

Voteup is a fun and simple-to-use app to see how your values compare to the values of the presidential candidates in the 2020 election.

## Goal
Less than 40% of people under 30 turn out for the election. Much of the huddle is due to complexity in understanding candidate positioning. Voter turnout is even less in minority groups. Our goal is to make the process of learning fun and easy so that more people will show up for the November election.
